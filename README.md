# Ultrasonic Guided Wave Dataset for Delamination Damage Identification

This repository contains the ultrasonic guided wave dataset used for identifying delamination damage in composite structures. The dataset is derived from the publication:

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes raw ultrasonic guided-wave signals with consistent excitation components removed, leaving only the sections exhibiting significant variations. The dataset has been normalized for amplitude and damage location to avoid scale-related biases.

### Key Features
1. **Amplitude Normalization**:
   - All waveform signals are normalized to the range of [-1, 1].
2. **Damage Location Normalization**:
   - Damage locations are normalized to [0, 1], representing the range of 30cm to 70cm, in 5mm increments.
3. **Categorized Data**:
   - Includes both Out-of-Distribution (OOD) and In-Distribution (ID) datasets with varying noise levels and experimental conditions.

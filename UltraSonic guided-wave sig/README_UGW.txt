G07. Description of the dataset
The ultrasonic guided-wave data has been used in the paper “Deep learning uncertainty quantification for ultrasonic damage identification in composite structures” in Composites Structures.

The raw ultrasonic signals have had their consistent excitation component removed, leaving only the sections that exhibit the main variations. The amplitude of all waveform signals has been normalized to the range of [-1,1]. Additionally, the damage location has been normalized to the range of [0,1] in increments of 5mm, covering a distance of 30cm to 70cm. This is to avoid any potential effects of scale differences.

The datasets used for categorized as OOD (three noise levels in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). ) and ID datasets:

OOD datasets:
（1）The 9 waveform signals within each normalized damage location range of [0.2, 0.3] correspond to an SNR of 10 dB (10dB normalized delamination damage position at 0.2 to 0.3 and 5dB at 0.7 to 0.8.csv);
（2）The 9 waveform signals within each normalized damage location range of [0.7, 0.8] correspond to an SNR of 5 dB (10dB normalized delamination damage position at 0.2 to 0.3 and 5dB at 0.7 to 0.8.csv);
（3）The 81 waveform signals within each normalized damage location range of [0, 1] correspond to a noise-free one (Noise-free normalized delamination damage position at 0 to 1.csv).

ID datasets:
The 81 waveform signals within each normalized damage location range of [0, 1] correspond to the averaged value of the 30 times at each damage location with random white Gaussian noise SNRs of 10 dB (Averaged 10dB normalized delamination damage position at 0 to 1.csv).
The average value of the 30 waveform signals is computed at each damage location after normalization to simulate the real experimental de-noising.

Ultrasonic guided-wave data generated from transient ultrasonic guided wave propagation model considering composite beam structures. The parameters of a wave propagation model are generated by performing FEM simulations using Abaqus. FEM notes: solid elements (i.e. C3D8R in Abaqus) with the following dimensions: 0.5mm thick, 0.5mm wide, and 0.2mm long. Damage modes are modelled by node duplication. Ultrasonic tests data: 6-cycle Hanning windowed sinusoid centered at 100 kHz of frequency. Excitation signal at one end of the beam in the vertical direction. Sensor situated at 0.2m from the point of excitation and measuring for 720 \mu s. The first antisymmetric mode (A0) is excited. Cross-ply carbon fibre composite beam (dimensions: 1m x 3mm x 2mm) with [0_{2}/90]_s stacking sequence and delamination (5mm long at L mm from excitation) in it, where L is the damage location.
